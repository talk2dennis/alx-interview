# ALX Mock Interview - Pascal's Triangle

This directory contains the code for generating Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

## Files

- `pascal_triangle.py`: This file contains the implementation of the Pascal's Triangle generation algorithm.
- `test_pascal_triangle.py`: This file contains the unit tests for the `pascal_triangle.py` file.

## Usage

To generate Pascal's Triangle, simply run the `pascal_triangle.py` file. The program will prompt you to enter the number of rows you want in the triangle. After entering the number, the program will display the Pascal's Triangle on the console.

```bash
$ python pascal_triangle.py
Enter the number of rows: 5
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```
